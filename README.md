#Vandalless

This is a system that can be used to monitor BTS communication towers and protect them from being tampered with. The system consists of an accelerometer to detect if someone has tampered with the communication tower, and a light sensor to detect when the box has been opened. If accelerometer sensor is triggered, the anti vandalism system sends data to the server via LoRaWAN protocol.
